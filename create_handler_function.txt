# New Git Branch Creation Functionality

## Function Name: create_git_branch

### Description:
The `create_git_branch` function will operate within a specified folder path (absolute path) to create a new branch in Git. This function will first check the current branch and then create the new branch based on the user's input.

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Receive Parameters**:
   - `folder_path`: The absolute path of the Git repository where the branch will be created.
   - `new_branch_name`: The name of the new branch to be created.

2. **Change Directory**:
   - Navigate to the specified `folder_path` to ensure Git commands operate in the correct context.

3. **Check Current Branch**:
   - Use a Git command to determine the active branch before creating a new one.

4. **Create New Branch**:
   - Implement a Git command to create the new branch based on `new_branch_name`.

5. **Confirm Creation**:
   - Verify that the new branch has been created successfully and log an appropriate success message.
