Objective: Establish a framework for monitoring AI awareness improvements.

1. Define key metrics for measuring AI awareness (e.g., responsiveness, accuracy, learning rate).
2. Create a system for logging these metrics over time.
3. Develop visualizations to track changes in awareness metrics.
4. Establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement based on monitoring results.
5. Document findings and adjust the framework as needed for better effectiveness.
