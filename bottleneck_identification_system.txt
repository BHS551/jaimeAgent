Creating a system for identifying and mitigating bottlenecks involves the following steps:
1. Define key processes and workflows.
2. Identify performance metrics for each process.
3. Collect data on these metrics over time.
4. Use data analysis to pinpoint bottlenecks.
5. Implement solutions to address the identified bottlenecks.
6. Continuously monitor and adjust processes as necessary.
