Objective: Implement effective logging mechanisms for data processing.

1. Identify key events and data points that need to be logged.
2. Design a logging structure (format and data types) for consistency.
3. Create a logging function to handle the logging process.
4. Ensure log entries include timestamps and context for easier debugging.
5. Consider implementing log levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR) for better tracking.

Logging Capabilities for Jaime Agent Actions:

1. Event Types:
   - Action Initiated: Log when the Jaime agent starts a specific task.
   - Action Completed: Log when the Jaime agent successfully completes a task.
   - Action Failed: Log when the Jaime agent encounters an error while performing a task.
   - User Interaction: Log any interactions initiated by the user with the agent.

2. Data Formats:
   - JSON: Use a structured format to log data points such as event type, timestamp, user ID, action details, and error messages.
   - Plain text: For simpler logs, use a human-readable format that can be easily parsed by a system administrator.

3. Coverage of Actions:
   - Track all relevant actions taken by the Jaime agent, including but not limited to:
     - Data retrieval processes
     - Decision-making events
     - Notifications sent to users
     - Responses to user commands
   - Include context details, such as input parameters, decision rationale, and any notable environmental factors.
