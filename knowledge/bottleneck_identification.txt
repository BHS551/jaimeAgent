Objective: Identify bottlenecks in current information processing techniques.

1. Review existing information processing workflows to understand the sequence of operations.
2. Collect metrics on processing times for each step in the workflow.
3. Identify steps with the longest processing times or highest resource consumption.
4. Analyze the causes of delays or inefficiencies in these bottleneck areas.
5. Document recommendations for optimizing or re-engineering bottleneck processes.
