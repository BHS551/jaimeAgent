Objective: Assess the effectiveness of current algorithms in use.

1. Define metrics for measuring algorithm performance (accuracy, speed, etc.).
2. Collect data on current algorithm outputs across various scenarios.
3. Compare collected data against defined performance metrics.
4. Identify strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm based on findings.
5. Document recommendations for algorithm improvements or alternatives.
